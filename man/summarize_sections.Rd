\title{Retrieve the timestamps for track section based on conditions.}
\usage{
find_sections_(tracks, ..., tol = 1, .dots)

summarize_sections(sections, tracks, ...)

summarize_sections_(sections, tracks, ..., .dots)
}
\arguments{
\item{tracks}{A table with track sections (output from
\code{find_track_sections}).}

\item{...}{Summary statements.}

\item{.dots}{Used to work around non-standard evaluation. See vignette("nse")
for details.}

\item{tracks}{A tracks object.}
}
\value{
A tbl_df.
}
\description{
Similar to \code{filter}, but returns a table of sequences grouped by trial,
with a \code{start}, \code{stop} and \code{length} column. It supports a
tolerance level which allows for combining sequences that are close together
(the default of 1 is zero tolerance).
}
\details{
Any variables used as conditions will be looked up in the \code{tr},
\code{pairs} and \code{group} tables and applied when present. Non-existing
variables will not produce an error.

Seperate conditions on different variables with a \code{,}, not \code{&}.
Combine several conditions on the same variable with \code{&}.

Example use case: If one has selected all sequences of frames where animals
are chasing each other, one can calculate the mean speed for each of the
chase sequences.
