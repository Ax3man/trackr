Description: This package contains functions to perform analysis on and
    visualization of tracking data. It is designed for use with video tracking
    data, usually of animals. Data from common tracking software, such as ctrax
    and idTracker can be imported into a trackr object. The package aims to
    seperate the data analysis from the tracking software and establish common
    easily available analysis routines across tracking technologies, using the
    dominant language amongst biologists: R.
